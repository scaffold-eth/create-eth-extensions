export const extraContents = `## ðŸš€ Setup ERC-20 Token Extension

This extension introduces an ERC-20 token contract and demonstrates how to use interact with it, including getting a holder balance and transferring tokens.

The ERC-20 Token Standard introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens ([EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)), in other words, each Token is exactly the same (in type and value) as any other Token.

The ERC-20 token contract is implemented using the [ERC-20 token implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) from OpenZeppelin.

### Setup

Deploy your contract running \`\`\`yarn deploy\`\`\`

### Interact with the token

Start the front-end with \`\`\`yarn start\`\`\` and go to the _/erc20_ page to interact with your deployed ERC-20 token.

You can check the code at \`\`\`packages/nextjs/app/erc20/page.tsx\`\`\`.
