# Example Extension for Scaffold-ETH 2

This extension demonstrates how to create a custom Scaffold-ETH 2 extension.

It includes examples of all possible `.args.mjs` files and demonstrates how to replace default contracts with custom implementations, add custom deployment scripts and contract tests, and integrate custom Next.js page.

Based on [ERC-20 extension](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/create-eth-extensions/tree/erc-20) contracts.
