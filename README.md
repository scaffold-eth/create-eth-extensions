# ERC-20 Token Extension for Scaffold-ETH 2

This extension introduces an ERC-20 token contract and demonstrates how to use interact with it, including getting a holder balance and transferring tokens.

The ERC-20 Token Standard introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens ([EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)), in other words, each Token is exactly the same (in type and value) as any other Token.

The ERC-20 token contract is implemented using the [ERC-20 token implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) from OpenZeppelin.

## Installation

You can install any of the extensions in this repository by running the following command:
